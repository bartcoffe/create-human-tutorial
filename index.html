Class is like a blueprint. We start by defining set of objects' characteristics and behaviors (we call those attributes and methods). Once the blueprint is in place, we can take it and bring to life, or instantiate, whole populations of objects at a glance.

Let's look onto the act of creation. First line is a class declaration. It starts a recipe for a Human. Last line brings the Human to life. Everything in between is the stuff that Human is set to be and do.
Each Human has some characteristics like eyes color, a mysterious lucky number and even more mysterious iq number. Adam defined at the very bottom is an instance of a Human class and he has blue eyes, low iq and can't do anything at the moment - but that's about to change.

            <h2>Instance attributes</h2>
            <p>
Instance attributes are variables that contain data that is unique to each instance. Creation of Adam involved code like this: Human('Adam', 80_000, 'blue', 7, 66). What do these values correspond to? Well, if you look closely, values inside parentheses almost perfectly correspond to arguments in __init__ method defined inside a Human class. __init__ is a special method responsible for the act of creation. On each human creation, it demands us to provide its essential characteristics.
            </p>
            <p>
I said that values inside parentheses almost perfectly correspond to arguments in __init__ method. Why almost? Well, at the first place, there's a self argument. Self denotes to-be-born instance - like a piece of marble about to be sculpted. Each method inside a class receives an instance as a first argument. By convention, we call it self, it is not a requirement to call it that, just a good practice. We'll see more of self once dive deeper.                
            </p>
            <p>
By writing self.name = name inside __init__ , we create name attribute in our instance (left side of the assignment) and assign name value that we passed in parentheses to it (right side of the assignment). Look at the example below to better visualize this. Those two snippets produce the same result, using __init__ just automates the process of creation (often called initialization or construction)

            <p>
                Class attributes are variables that contain data that is shared among all instances of a class. Of course, you could set values that don't change as instance variables, but it's just less versatile. There are several situations when you really want to be using class attributes.

        if name == 'Amor':
            self.find_true_love_probability = 0.1402

            </div>
            <p>
                When we want to access class attribute we need to do so either by an instance or by class itself. 
                In example above, when we try to print jean.find_true_love_probability we get a value back as we'd expect. What is interesting to note here though, its that this value is not actually available directly inside the instance. Why does it work then? Well, when we try to access any attribute of an object, python will look in multiple places. it will start in the instance it was called, when doesn't find what it looks for, it will then move on to the class it's defined out of. Next, if it's still not there it will try to go up the chain of parent classes until lucky. It is good to be aware of that to prevent some unexpected results. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If your name is Amor, you get more chances to find love. It's because Amor's instance attribute of find_true_love_probability defined in __init__ will be encountered and returned without the need to look anywhere else. It's good to be able to, in some cases, have an instance attribute overwrite some 'default' class attribute while still primarily rely on this 'fallback' feature.
                Another use case for a class variable can be counting all humans that ever tasted earth life. Individual humans have no reason to mess with that count, its only for internal purposes of Foundational Bureau of IHΣΟΥΣ

            <p>
Humans pray the best they can. In this case, 'the best' one actually can has whole lot to do with their hairline. But it is not the point. The point is use of self. Since prayer behaviors are differentiated by their respective hairiness, Derek should pray differently than Helen. And sure enough our class accommodates for just that!                 
            </p>
            <p>
                Remember, each method inside a class receives an instance as a first argument. 
                Upon creation, our humans got some numerical values of hair count. They got passed to respective __init__ methods and they've become their characteristics. When we called derek.pray() what happened was:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
an instance of the class got passed as a first argument 
                </li>
                <li>
instance was received as self
                </li>
                <li>
derek's attribute of hair_on_head_count was accessed, it turned out to be 80_123. 
                </li>
                <li>
based on that value appropriate prayer was returned.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We can actually make python reveal this whole 'method receives an instance as a first argument' behavior in at least two ways shown below. Let's write a class with a method that doesn't take any arguments. When we try to call it - we sure get na error message stating '<method_name>() takes 0 positional arguments but 1 was given'
            </p>

Statements above are exactly the same - second line just shows more explicitly what happens internally. Again, this is why we need to always write self as a first argument in methods. Self gets passed automatically.

There's a lot going on in an example above. First, take a look at OrdinaryHuman. It is a class that inherits from a Human and has nothing more to offer. When we try create an instance of it, we notice that it demands the same init arguments as a Human. Similarly to the example on class attributes, here, on creation of OrdinaryHuman, python looked for init, it didn't find it so went up to the parent, found it there and run it. It is called method resolution order. To better visualize it, run built-in help function on any class

By leveraging inheritance, we can access parent class' parameters and methods. (we have access to Humans' do_1000_pushups method, __init__ and strength_to_weight_ratio class attribute)
            </p>
            <p>
The other benefit of inheritance is an ability to create more fine-grained objects. Look at Hunter class, hunters are Humans but they are, on average, stronger and care about size of their spears.
To differentiate them in such way while keeping the human defaults, we can use super() method that allows us to access methods of the base class. In our case, we want to access __init__ of Human, use Human's characteristics and then add an extra one on top of that (spear_length attribute). It's way shorter and more readable than re-assigning all attributes. 
Apart from new attribute, we created a method that makes sense only for hunters. Let's play with it a bit.

In our little ecosystem humans, but not aliens, have names, all humans can do pushups to get stronger but only hunters can compare spears
            </p>
            <p>
Take a minute to read about isinstance (it supports inheritance) type (it doesn't support inheritance) hasattr, issubclass methods found in compare_spears. Also, look at do_1000_pushups method and see that humans and hunters get different default strength and the method respects that.
            </p>
            <p>
A common usecase for subclasses is creating custom exceptions. In many real-world projects we can see empty class of < MyCustomException >(Exception) because we want to be specific about the name of exception but not necessarily implement any custom logic with regards to it. We took this approach within compare_spears.

We already touched on and used special methods (__init__) but without due explanation. Special methods allow us to emulate some built-in behaviors and we implement operator overloading with them. You recognize special method by the double undersores (also called dunder).

            <p>
Probably the most common special methods are __str__ and __repr__. Those methods are implicitly called when we call repr() and str() on our objects. So, when we print(object), the result will depend on how we implemented  __str__ method. If __str__ is not implemented, __repr__ acts as a fallback so it's good to have at least that. What are differences between the two? __repr__ should prove unambigous, over readable - it's for developers' use. A good idea is to make __repr__ return a string that can be copied and pasted to the terminal to re-create the object. 
On the other hand,  __str__ should be more readable, as it's meant to be seen by class user.

            <p>
Some Humans are special agents. Their identity changes a lot. Let's take a look at a class below. First, let's say, we want to be able to access agent' full name as a separate attribute. At first glance it could be feasible to create an attribute inside __init__  (commented line of code in example below). Sure, it works, but what happens when agent changes their name? Since fullname was created at object creation, it won't 'see' whether name or surname changed at some point. To make it work correctly, we'd need to update it independently on each change.
Instead, we should be using something that grabs the current value of name and surname and construes fullname off it - like a fullname() method. This works but we end up with changed syntax - from instance.fullname to instance.fullname() - that breaks the user code. More aesthetically still, it doesn't fit the convention - displaying full name isn't any action, it would look weird accessing it using parentheses. Those considerations lead us towards the solution which is a property decorator. It allows us to access methods as attributes, see agent_fullname method below.               
            </p>
            <div class="code-snippet">

Agent goes on a mission. Missions demand their identity changed and also for each mission agent can receive some custom attributes that might not be specified for other agents. It would be nice to be able to just provide a dictionary containing info specific to the mission and hope that all data sent by agent's handler for this assignment will be transformed into agent-specific attributes. Also, when mission is over, we'd like to burn all the data and make agent indistinguishable from an ordinary human. All without tormenting the class user. We can do so by using a setter and deleter decorators. Setters allow us to trigger certain changes upon attribute change, deleters, when we use del keyword
            </p>
            <p>
In @fullname.setter we can set agent_name and agent_surname attributes by providing agent_fullname.  
            </p>
            <p>
In @agent_info.setter we receive a dict of mission info. For each key-pair in the dictionary we update (or create if doesn't exist yet) an instance attribute. It also affects @fullname.setter. Similarly, we have a deleter that will take care of deleting enetered data when the time comes. In our case, deleter deletes all attributes so that Agent is indistinguishable from ordinary human.

Pay attention to the following: we have an access to agent_name even though it wasn't passed in the dict. It is because when agent_info.setter was setting each record in dict, when it got to agent_fullname, it found agent_fullname.setter  that divided fullname into two separate attributes.

Lastly, print namespace of Mary after deletion - there's only her real name and surname here. she's no agent!

If no __init__ method is generated, then __post_init__ will not automatically be called. Among other uses, this allows for initializing field values that depend on one or more other fields.
